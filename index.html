          <h3>1. Weight management</h3>
          <p>
            Cycling habitually, especially at a high intensity, helps lower body
            fat levels, which promotes healthy weight management. Plus, you’ll
            increase your metabolism and build muscle, which allows you to burn
            more calories, even while at rest.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>2. Leg strength</h3>
          <p>
            Cycling improves overall function in your lower body and strengthens
            your leg muscles without overstressing them. It targets your quads,
            glutes, hamstrings, and calves.

          <h3>3. It’s good for beginners</h3>
          <p>
            It’s simple to ride a bike. If you have difficulty with a standard
            bicycle, stationary bikes are a great alternative.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re new to fitness or are bouncing back from an injury or
            illness, you can cycle at a low intensity. As you get more fit, you
            can increase the intensity or continue to cycle at a chill pace.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>4. Core workout</h3>
          <p>
            Cycling also works your core muscles, including your back and
            abdominals. Maintaining your body upright and keeping the bike in
            position requires a certain amount of core strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong abdominals and back muscles support your spine, increase
            stability, and improve comfort while cycling.

        <h3>5. Boosts mental health</h3>
        <p>
          Cycling can ease feelings of stress, depression, or anxiety. Focusing
          on the road while you’re cycling helps develop concentration and
          awareness of the present moment. This may help take your focus away
          from the mental chatter of your day.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find yourself feeling lethargic or listless, get yourself on
          your bike for at least 10 minutes. Exercise releases endorphins, which
          in turn help you feel better while lowering stress levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may feel more confident and content once you make cycling a
          regular part of your life.

          <h3>6. It can help people with cancer</h3>
          <p>
            Cycling is a fantastic addition to your care plan if you have or are
            recovering from cancer. Cycling can also keep you lean and fit,
            which may reduce your risk for certain types of cancer, including
            breast cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to research from 2019, staying active if you have breast
            cancer may help reduce side effects of cancer treatment, including
            fatigue, and improve your overall quality of life.

          <h3>7. A positive start to your morning</h3>
          <p>
            Start your day with a healthy activity like cycling, which wakes you
            up by boosting your circulation and allows you to start your day
            with a sense of accomplishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may feel more inclined to make healthy, positive choices as the
            day progresses. Fasted morning rides at a low intensity may burn
            fat, enhance endurance performance, and boost your energy and
            metabolism levels all day. A 2019 study found that people who
            exercised before breakfast for 6 weeks improved their response to
            insulin, which helped them burn twice as much fat as those who
            exercised after breakfast.

          <h3>8. Prevents and manages medical conditions</h3>
          <p>
            Whether you want to prevent health concerns from arising or manage
            existing conditions, regular exercise is key. Cycling regularly is
            one way to avoid a sedentary lifestyle and its accompanying health
            concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can help prevent cardiac issues such as stroke, heart attack, and
            high blood pressure. Cycling may also help prevent and manage type 2
            diabetesTrusted Source.

          <h3>9. It’s environmentally friendly</h3>
          <p>
            Reduce your carbon footprint by riding your bike whenever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cycling is a great replacement for transport options that involve
            sitting in traffic for extended periods. It’s especially useful when
            you’re going places that are a bit too far to walk, but you still
            don’t want to take a car.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bonus is not having to fight for a parking space in crowded areas.

          <h3>10. Improves balance, posture, and coordination</h3>
          <p>
            As you stabilize your body and keep your bike upright, you’ll
            improve your overall balance, coordination, and posture. Balance
            tends to decline with age and inactivity, so it’s vital to keep on
            top of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improved balance is beneficial in the prevention of falls and
            fractures, which can leave you on the sidelines while you take time
            off from exercise to recover.
          </p>

          <h3>11. It’s a low impact option</h3>
          <p>
            Cycling is easy on your body, making it a gentle option for people
            who want an intense workout without stressing their joints. Cycling
            is a great option for people who have joint concerns or overall
            stiffness, especially in the lower body.
